# Chess Game using Python and Pygame (https://shafquatulbari.github.io/chess-game-python/build/web/index.html)

This project is a fully functional chess game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to interact with the game board and pieces seamlessly. The core components and features of this game are:

## Game State Management

- The game maintains an internal representation of the chess board and manages the state of the game, including whose turn it is, the positions of all pieces, and special moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- The game state is updated with each move, ensuring the rules of chess are enforced.

## Move Validation and Execution

- The game engine validates all possible moves according to chess rules and determines valid moves for each piece.
- Special conditions like check, checkmate, and stalemate are detected and handled appropriately.
- The game allows players to undo moves and reset the board.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- The game features a visually appealing and interactive chess board, where each piece is represented by an image.
- Players can select and move pieces using mouse clicks, and the game highlights valid moves for the selected piece.
- The GUI updates dynamically to reflect the current state of the game after each move.

## AI Integration

- The game includes an AI opponent that can make moves based on a combination of algorithms such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- The AI evaluates the board state and determines the best possible move to make, providing a challenging opponent for human players.

## Animations and User Feedback

- The game includes smooth animations for piece movement, enhancing the visual experience.
- Messages are displayed to notify players of checkmate, stalemate, and other important game states.

## Customization and Extensibility

- The game's design allows for easy customization and extension, such as adding new features or improving the AI.

This chess game project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, game development using Pygame, and implementing complex algorithms for move validation and AI decision-making. It serves as an excellent showcase of skills in software development and game design.
